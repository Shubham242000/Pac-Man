# Pac-Man
In Pac-Man, the player makes a Pac-Man, a yellow disc, move around a maze. The ghosts are Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal is to eat every green pellet (circles) while not getting caught by the ghosts/monsters When Pac-Man eats a big pellet, the ghosts turn blue and can be eaten.  
There's an interesting trivia around the game , The game is called Puck-Man in Japan. The game was renamed to Pac-Man in the United States so that nobody could change the "P" to "F" ðŸ‘€.

Here I have used Vanilla JavaScript to implement the game. This uses things like  - 
setInterval(), 
setTimeout(), 
class, 
Math functions, 
Array functions, 
DOM Manipulation etc.
